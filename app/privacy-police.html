	<h3>
	   WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
	</h3>
	<p>VeganLoveLink is a service for people who have reached the age of eighteen, the main purpose of which is to meet and communicate with new people. You can use the services that we provide in different ways: through the Telegram mobile application for the Android or iOS platform. By registering with Flirtu, you are entering into a legal agreement with us and we process your data for the purpose of providing a service in accordance with the terms of this agreement.
	</p>
	<p>To become a VeganLoveLink user, you need to create a profile. During registration, we may ask you to provide the following information: name, email address, gender, date of birth, your location. You can also provide other information about yourself by entering it in your profile, but these are not required. You control your profile and have permanent access to this data in the "Profile" section on Flirtu, where all data can be corrected or updated (except for the identification number - id).</p>
	<p>Please be careful when posting personal information such as your health or sexual orientation on your profile. Please be aware that photos or videos you post on VeganLoveLink may disclose this kind of personal information. If you provide or upload personal information about yourself, you consent to its processing and publication in the public domain.</p>
	<p>In the interests of security and in order to improve the user experience, the user's personal profile is linked to his Telegram account. This is only necessary to ensure that the personal profile belongs to you. We also fight against the creation of fake accounts that can be used to harm other users, as well as to commit cybercrimes - such accounts pose a threat to the Flirtu community and prevent other users from enjoying communication. We use your Telegram account data based on the above legitimate interests and to prevent fraud and cybercrime.</p>
	<p>If you purchase any premium services while using VeganLoveLink, we will process your payment information and store it securely for fraud prevention and audit and / or tax purposes. In accordance with data protection law, we need to collect and process this payment data in order to fulfill our obligations to you, the storage of this data is justified by our legitimate interests outlined above.</p>
	<p>In order to provide users with a free, non-premium service, we process a number of data (demographic data and location) in order to attract targeted advertising in our legitimate interests, including the transfer of such data to advertisers. In your device's security settings, you also have the ability to prevent or restrict device identifiers that will be shared with third-party advertisers and how these identifiers are used.</p>
	<p>We use SSL security protocol. The Merchant will not sell, buy, provide, exchange or otherwise disclose Account or Transaction data, or personal information or information about the Cardholder to anyone other than the Acquirer, Visa / Mastercard Corporation (or other payment systems used) or in response to current government demands.</p>
	<p>We also want to keep in touch with you to inform you about our promotions and offers. If you agree to this, we will use your email address to send you such information. You can change your mind at any time in the Service Settings or at www.VeganLoveLink.com</p>
	
	<h3>WHAT DATA IS COLLECTED ABOUT ME IF I USE THE MOBILE OR DESKTOP TELEGRAM APP?
	</h3>
	
	<p>Wherever you are, with VeganLoveLink you have the opportunity to connect with your friends, make new acquaintances, as well as stay in touch with your contacts that you have acquired with our service. You can do this using a mobile phone or desktop version of the Telegram application.</p>
	<p>If you have the location feature turned on but want to turn it off, you can do this in your device's system settings.</p>
	<p>We and our partner advertisers may also store and use your device ID to serve targeted ads to you in-app. You can opt out of providing data to third parties, but you will still see generic ads in the app.</p>
	
	<h3>HOW LONG DOES VeganLoveLink STORE MY DATA?
	</h3>
	<p>If you do not use your account for 24 months, your profile and any data will be deleted. When you request the deletion of your profile, it is completely deleted within 48 hours of the day.</p>
	<p>Correspondence with our support team may be kept longer so that we can use it for any subsequent inquiries that may arise. Such correspondence is deleted after 3 years in the absence of requests.</p>
	<p>Anonymous information about activity on VeganLoveLink is stored longer for statistical data and market research, but it is not associated with you after you delete the profile, that is, it becomes anonymous. This is due to the fact that Flirtu strives to develop its services and opportunities for more convenient communication and such a period is justified by our legitimate interest.</p>
	<p>Information such as billing information, IP addresses, mobile numbers and email addresses is retained to combat fraud and spam as long as it is relevant. Usually this period is determined by the validity period of the payment method.</p>
	<h3>WHAT INFORMATION DOES VeganLoveLink COLLECT ABOUT ME IF I AM NOT 18 YEARS OLD?
	
	
	</h3>
	<p>VeganLoveLink does not knowingly collect any information about minors. We do not engage or encourage the use of our service by persons under the age of majority. If we become aware of the registration of a user before the age of majority, established by the law of the country of residence of the EU citizen, and the provision of their personal data to them, we will take measures to remove such a profile and any information about it from VeganLoveLink. If we deleted your profile because you violated our minimum age rule, we may store your email and IP addresses so that you do not try to circumvent our rules by creating a new one. </p>
	<h3>WHAT INFORMATION DOES VeganLoveLink COLLECT ABOUT MY FRIENDS AND CONTACTS?

If some of the invitees do not register within a few days after the invitation, we can send them a reminder of your invitation. You can invite all your friends or just some of them, but please remember the minimum age on VeganLoveLink. You are responsible for ensuring that your friends agree to receive invitations.</p>
	<p>We do not sell these contacts or use them to send any messages other than an invitation. A friend you know can contact VeganLoveLink and request that their information be removed from our database by writing to <a href="https://
